# Introduction
This ROS-WiFi camera module integrates the ESP32-S3 chip, a 2MP camera, a black 3D printed case, can be used for wireless image transmission of ROS2 robots. Users can configure WiFi network through the serial port module to achieve smoother wireless image transmission in the same LAN. Using the microROS protocol, the module can provide real-time image data to the host computer equipped with ROS2 system, thereby realizing a series of AI visual recognition functions. Yahboom provides OpenCV image processing example codes and MediaPipe algorithm application cases.

# Features
1. Integrate ESP32-S3 high-performance chip and 2MP camera to ensure clear image transmission.

2. Configure wireless network information through the serial port module to achieve smoother wireless image transmission.

3. Images can be transmitted to the host computer(PC)with ROS2 through microROS to complete AI visual recognition functions.

4. For ROS2 robots, it is a very cost-effective peripheral that can achieve wireless image transmission.
